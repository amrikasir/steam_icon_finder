# steam_icon_finder
(Windows Only)

This Python script is on high development, I mean, I use Notepad and nothing advanced features here.
just read all the shortcuts on your Desktop, filter it just for Steam games, download the icon and TADAAAAA.

## Prerequisites
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [main.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amrikasir/steam_icon_finder/main/main.py)
- requests module

## Install requests module using pip
```bash
pip install requests
```

## CAUTIONS
place the ```main.py``` file in your DESKTOP, not anywhere you like :-D ( don't ask me why cz I learn python for this purpose, you can pull-request to make this script better and do more things )
